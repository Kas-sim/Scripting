A collection of small scripts I use to learn, automate, and refine my workflow in arch.  
This repo is my sandbox: part learning ground, part utility box.

## 🚀 Notes
- Written for **Arch Linux / Linux environments**
- using Neovim  
- Scripts may be rough or experimental — this is a journey log as much as a toolkit  
- Expect updates as I continue learning Bash and automation

📌 *This list will grow — each script is another step toward mastering Bash & system scripting.*
